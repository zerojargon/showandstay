# ShowAndStay

**A very simple / quick rework of http://www.show-and-stay.co.uk/**

Live demo available at http://showandstay.zerojargon.com/

## Please note:

* I don't have an issue with the current version of the site, this is simply another take on it.
* GIF files have been used on hover of the shows. In production I'd use html5 video instead, as this is FAR more bandwidth-friendly.
* Although I've included bootstrap, I have only really used it for the Grid system, and the styling of the inputs themselves (not the datepicker). I've tried to make most of the styling my own, without the assistance of any frameworks. This is because I figure the reason for this task is you wanting to know how I'd approach the styling, and I feel that using frameworks to achieve this would be cheating a bit!
* One main bit I'd like to point out is that on this you can either select shows OR a date. I noticed on the current side that you need to choose a show before you can select a date. I thought an either / or solution might be beneficial. When I spoke to Luke, he mentioned that the analytics have shown the userbase for Show & Stay to be primarily couples (2.1 tickets on average, from memory). I believe this could hint at one person "treating" another, for a special occasion (birthday etc). If that's the case, then the date could be just as important as the show, and a person may be restricted to a certain weekend / day, which isn't catered for particularly well on the current version.  (I haven't implemented the filtering functionality - I figure this demonstration was for design, but could implement the javascript side of things if requested)
* I'm well aware that there are likely to be certain elements required in terms of branding, which I have missed out. Being unaware of what these are, I have chosen not to try and guess, but these could be implemented.
* The primary navigation would need work for mobile devices.
